# autobattler-3d
Getting our feet wet with Godot 3D.
Top-down 3D game with a fixed camera. The game will transition between two views, an exploration and combat view.
Combat will be a simple auto battler where you just have to place some units.


Some stuff I would like to look into in this project:
- [ ] Moving the camera smoothly along a BÃ©zier-Curve
  - used for transitioning between exploration and combat
- [ ] Texture blending using noise
  - used to mix grass and dirt textures
- [ ] Transparency type shader effect
  - Used when the player model is covered by environment
- [x] Making pretty clouds
  - well, they're cartoony but work 
- [x] Using 3D Particle shaders
  - used for dust when the player is dashing
- [x] Using Vertex displacement shaders
  - used when walking through tall grass in exploration view
